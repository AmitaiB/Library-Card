Library Card
============

Library Card is an experimental app that scans a book's barcode (or that takes an ISBN entered by hand) and looks it up using Google Books. It was intended to be used to keep track of what you're reading and have read... until I discovered that Goodreads's app had a barcode scanner.

After that it was an educational exercise in using the (then-new) storyboards in iOS.

It may or may not compile, it may or may not work, the third-party libraries that are included here have probably been updated many times since. Hopefully some of the code might be useful to someone somewhere sometime.
